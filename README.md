# NaiveBayes-Classifier-for-PDF-document

A Naive Bayes classifier for analyzing the content of PDF documents using NLTK and PyPDF2.

## Introduction

This project is a Naive Bayes classifier designed to analyze the content of PDF documents. It uses the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) for text processing and PyPDF2 for extracting text from PDF files. The classifier can be trained on labeled data and then used to classify new PDF documents into predefined categories.

## Features

- PDF document text extraction
- Text preprocessing (tokenization, stop word removal, etc.)
- Naive Bayes classification
- Training on labeled data
- Classification of new PDF documents

## Prerequisites

Before using this classifier, you should have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- NLTK library (`pip install nltk`)
- PyPDF2 library (`pip install PyPDF2`)
